"""The Command Design Pattern in Python
The command pattern is a behavioural design pattern, in which an abstraction
exists between an object that invokes a command, and the object that performs it.
This is part 2 of the Command Design Pattern tutorial,
where I create a slider, instead of the switch from part 1.
The slider also accepts a variable percentage, rather than an ON/OFF
The history also records the variable settingg
And I also add UNDO/REDO to the Invoker so that you can go backawards and forwards through time
